# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). With TinyApp, users have the ability to save and access 
their favourite website, all under one website. How cool is that? It also allows users to edit or replace their url lists to whatever they prefer.
